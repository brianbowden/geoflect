Ideas for Camera Data:

- Run ImageMagick filters to adjust brightness, contrast, and "blendability". Hopefully it's possible to overlay and not multiply.
- Create blended traffic overlays for each camera for a each (half-hour?) time slot to determine when the best time is to leave
- Create camera compositions that span the last 7 days and the last 7 Thursdays, for instance
- Use incident/construction history to provide context for image stories (yep, that's what we're calling them)
- Provide ability to remove days with irregular incidents

Hard Problems:

- Determine when you should leave for work to get home the fastest. This may involve blending in Google Maps data.
